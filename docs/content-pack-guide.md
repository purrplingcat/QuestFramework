# Content pack guide

aka how to use JSON API for creating content packs with your custom quests.

## Introduction

### What is quest framework?

Quest framework is a "core" mod which provides a tools for work with quests in StardewValley. In the JSON api you can do these things:

- Create custom quests
- Handle quests with predefined hooks

## Define quest

### Prepare content pack

For more info about SMAPI content packs see [How to create content pack](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Content_packs)

Create your `manifest.json` file which must contains these minimum contents:

```js
{
  "Name": "Your Project Name",
  "Author": "your name",
  "Version": "1.0.0",
  "Description": "One or two sentences about the mod.",
  "UniqueID": "YourName.YourProjectName",
  "MinimumApiVersion": "3.6.0",
  "UpdateKeys": [],
  "ContentPackFor": {
    "UniqueID": "PurrplingCat.QuestFramework", // Quest Framework unique id must be here
    "MinimumVersion": "1.0.0-alpha" // optional
  }
}
```

Then create file `quests.json` and follow next instructions.

### The content pack format

Your `quests.json` has this format:

```js
{
  "Format": "1.0", // this is required
  "Quests": [
    // quests are defined here
  ],
  "Offers": [
    // quest offers are defined here (optional)
  ]
}
```

## Hooks

You can add some "magic" to your custom quests with hooks. Hooks do specified action with your quests when something was triggered in the game.

Hooks has conditions for check if the action of hook will be triggered or not. There are two types of conditions: local and environment. You don't must specify all available conditions. You can specify conditions which you need.

Action | Which action will be executed (see actions)

#### Example

```js
{
  "Format": "1.0",
  "Quests": [
    {
      "Name": "my_custom_quest",
      "Type": "ItemDelivery", // Vanilla quest type
      "Title": "The purple lunch",
      "Description": "Abigail are very hungry. She wants to eat something special from mines.",

         // when farmer go near the tree on the west side of graveyard in Town
         // and when is sunny weather today
        {
          "When": "Tile",
          "Has": {
            "Location": "Town",
            "Area": "2038 5573 326 245",
            "Weather": "sunny"
          },
          "Action": "Accept"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Actions

There are these types of actions:

Action name     | Description

### Hook types

Some hook types has own specific conditions. See them bellow.
**NOTE:** For specialized hook type's conditions you cant't use the negation `not:` prefix. This prefix is only for [common conditions](common-environment-conditions) and for global custom conditions.

#### Location

This hook is triggered when player entered or leaved specific location and all other conditions are met.

Local condition | Description

If you specify both, then the hook action will be triggered when player left the Leave location and entered the Enter location. For example:

Enter condition is `Town` and leave condition is `BusStop`. This hook trigs their action when player entered Town from the Bus Stop.

Please refer to the conversation topic explanation on the wiki before using this feature. With this field you can make NPCs give dialogue when a quest is accepted, cancelled, and or completed. The respective dialogue itself must be added using [Content patcher] (https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/develop/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide.md#editdata)

## Compatibility with other mods

### Json Assets support

Quest Framework is compatible with JsonAssets mod. The framework supports JsonAssets objects for the `Trigger` quest field via token named `ja` and supports two item types: `object` and `bigcraftable`.

Token looks like: `{{ja: <itemName> [|bigcraftable]}}`

If you add suffix `|bigcraftable` after item name, then Quest Framework looks in the BigCraftable sheet. Otherwise looks in Object sheet.

#### Example

```js
{
  "Format": "1.0",
  "Quests": [
    {
      "Name": "willy_fish_oil", // No id needed, will be automatically generated
      "Type": "ItemDelivery", // Vanilla quest type
      "Title": "Fish Oil needed",
